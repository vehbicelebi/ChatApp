![Chat Application](./Bildschirm¬≠foto%202023-08-22%20um%2009.37.48.png)

This project is a chat application, that allows two users to communicate with a messenger. It has an authentication system, where you can sign in and your email and password will be stored in a firebase database. For these tasks I use firebase. 

It has also an integrated ChatBot with static responses, where you can ask specific questions that is listet below:

### Questions
+ Which book do you recommend?
+ What is the capital of turkey?
+ Which Programming Language should I learn as a beginner?
+ What is Spring Boot?
+ What is a Loop in Programming?
+ Which Series do you recommend?
+ What is SQL?
+ What is Django?

For this ChatBot I used Dialogflow from Google.
